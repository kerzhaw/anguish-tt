|     Travellers from an island off the coast of      |
|     Anguish have recently arrived in the            |
|     harbour of Tantallon, in search of aid.         |
|     A disaster has recently intruded into           |
|     their peaceful lives, and they require          |
|     outside assistance to deal with it.             |
|                                                     |
|     This quest is for mid-high level players.       |
|                                                     |
