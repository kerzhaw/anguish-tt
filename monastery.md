# Brother Boniface

> Hello Dawlish, please help me find Brother Urban's notes before it is too late!

> We do not know the secret of how to close the passageway. Brother Urban was constantly making notes during his studies. I am searching the monastery now, looking for these notes, but have had no luck.

> Brother Urban discovered a way to open a passage to the plane of Chaos. After we realised that we could not defeat the evil that lurks there, he searched his books for a way to close the passageway. He said that he had found a way to do it, but whatever it was, the secret died with him. If only he had written the secret down or told one of the brothers.

> Poor Brother Urban. He gave his life so that we could have time to flee.

> I must find Brother Urban's research notes. They will be a great aid to anyone that decides to assist us.

> The plane of Chaos is a source of evil! We thought we could destroy it, but it was too powerful for us.

> This monastery was built centuries ago to help spread
the word of Antana. It was abandoned during the Elf-
Human wars, however. We recently re-opened the
monastery after some...troubles in Neville.

> The Order did not think that Brother Urban's experiments were proper and sent us to this monastery on the Mare Stellarum. The Order feared that we would unleash evil on the world and wanted us far away. Unfortunately, they were correct.

> Antana came to Brother Urban in a vision and warned him not to open the passageway, but Brother Urban thought that it was a false vision, planted by the agents of Chaos.

> The ocean outside this monastery is known as the Mare Stellarum. It is said that humans came to Anguish from across that sea.
